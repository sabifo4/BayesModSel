# Path to your input tree with calibrations. If in the same directory,
# you only need to write the name. If in a different directory, please
# type the absolute or relative path to this file. You need to include the
# flags within square brackets (e.g., [Mammalia]) and write them on the node
# that is to be calibrated.
#
# NOTE: Make always sure that there is at least one blank line at the 
# end of the this text file! Otherwise, you will get an error telling you that 
# there is an incomplete final line in these files.


# Path to your input text file that allows you to match the flags you have 
# used to constrain node ages with the calibration you 
# want to use in `MCMCtree` notation. The format you need to follow is given
# below:
#
#   - Header.
#   - One row per calibration.
#   - No spaces at all, semi-colon separated.
#   - There are 4 columns:
#       - Name you want to give to the calibrated node (no spaces!).
#       - Name of one of the tips (e.g., tip 1) that leads to MRCA (no spaces!).
#       - Name of the other tip (e.g., tip 2) that leads to MRCA (no spaces!).
#       - Calibration in `MCMCtree` notation (no spaces!). More details on the 
#         `MCMCtree` notation you need to use in the fourth column in the PAML
#         documentation:
#         https://github.com/abacus-gene/paml/blob/master/doc/pamlDOC.pdf
# 
# E.g.: Header and one row in a calibration text file:
#
# ```
# name;tip1;tip2;MCMCtree
# root;sp1;sp2;'B(0.256,1.34,0.025,1e-300)'
# ```
#
# NOTE: Always check that there is at least one blank line at the 
# end of the this text file! Otherwise, you will get an error telling you that 
# there is an incomplete final line in these files. This file needs to be
# already in PHYLIP format. Please follow the same format as used in the 
# example tree file provided.
